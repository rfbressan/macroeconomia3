  abstract      = {SEQUELS ARE RARELY AS good as the originals, so I approach this review of the market efflciency literature with trepidation. The task is thornier than it was 20 years ago, when work on efficiency was rather new. The literature is now so large that a full review is impossible, and is not attempted here. Instead, I discuss the work that I find most interesting, and I offer my views on what we have learned from the research on market efficiency. I. The Theme I take the market efficiency hypothesis to be the simple statement that security prices fully reflect all available information. A precondition for this strong version of the hypothesis is that information and trading costs, the costs of getting prices to reflect information, are always 0 (Grossman and Stiglitz (1980)). A weaker and economically more sensible version of the efficiency hypothesis says that prices reflect information to the point where the marginal benefits of acting on information (the profits to be made) do not exceed the marginal costs (Jensen (1978)). Since there are surely positive information and trading costs, the extreme version of the market efficiency hypothesis is surely false. Its advantage, however, is that it is a clean benchmark that allows me to sidestep the messy problem of deciding what are reasonable information and trading costs. I can focus instead on the more interesting task of laying out the evidence on the adjustment of prices to various kinds of information. Each reader is then free to judge the scenarios where market efficiency is a good approximation (that is, deviations from the extreme version of the efficiency hypothesis are within information and trading costs) and those where some other model is a better simplifying view of the world. Ambiguity about information and trading costs is not, however, the main obstacle to inferences about market efficiency. The joint-hypothesis problem is more serious. Thus, market efficiency per se is not testable. It must be},

abstract = {Intraday Value-at-Risk (VaR) is one of the risk measures used by market participants involved in high-frequency trading. High-frequency log-returns feature important kurtosis (fat tails) and volatility clustering (extreme log-returns appear in clusters) that VaR models should take into account. We propose a marked point process model for the excesses of the time series over a high threshold that combines Hawkes processes for the exceedances with a generalized Pareto distribution model for the marks (exceedance sizes). The conditional approach features intraday clustering of extremes and is used to calculate instantaneous conditional VaR. The models are backtested on real data and compared to a competitor approach that proposes a nonparametric extension of the classical peaks-over-threshold method. Maximum likelihood estimation is computationally intensive; we use a differential evolution genetic algorithm to find adequate starting values for the optimization process.},

The superiority of our proposed model is exemplified by analyzing a data sample of nine different bivariate and one nine-dimensional financial portfolio.

We first discuss some general issues common to all statistical studies of financial time series. Various statistical properties of asset returns are then described: distributional properties, tail properties and extreme fluctuations, pathwise regularity, linear and nonlinear dependence of returns in time and across stocks. Our description emphasizes properties common to a wide variety of markets and instruments. We then show how these statistical properties invalidate many of the common statistical approaches used to study financial data sets and examine some of the statistical problems encountered in each case.},

The package provides a unified approach to fitting and simulating a wide variety of temporal point process or temporal marked point process models. The models are specified by an intensity function which is conditional on the history of the process. The user needs to provide routines for calculating the conditional intensity function. Then the package enables one to carry out maximum likelihood fitting, goodness of fit testing, simulation and comparison of models. The package includes the routines for the conditional intensity functions for a variety of standard point process models. The package is intended to simplify the fitting of point process models indexed by time in much the same way as generalized linear model programs have simplified the fitting of various linear models. The primary examples used in this paper are earthquake sequences but the package is intended to have a much wider applicability.},

abstract = { Abstract This article discusses several classes of stochastic models for the origin times and magnitudes of earthquakes. The models are compared for a Japanese data set for the years 1885���1980 using likelihood methods. For the best model, a change of time scale is made to investigate the deviation of the data from the model. Conventional graphical methods associated with stationary Poisson processes can be used with the transformed time scale. For point processes, effective use of such residual analysis makes it possible to find features of the data set that are not captured in the model. Based on such analyses, the utility of seismic quiescence for the prediction of a major earthquake is investigated. },

@article{Allen2013,
abstract = {Value-at-Risk (VaR) has become the universally accepted risk metric adopted internationally under the Basel Accords for banking industry internal control, capital adequacy and regulatory reporting. The recent extreme financial market events such as the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) commencing in 2007 and the following developments in European markets mean that there is a great deal of attention paid to risk measurement and risk hedging. In particular, to risk indices and attached derivatives as hedges for equity market risk. The techniques used to model tail risk such as VaR have attracted criticism for their inability to model extreme market conditions. In this paper we discuss tail specific distribution based Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and evaluate different methods that may be used to calculate VaR ranging from well known econometrics models of GARCH and its variants to EVT based models which focus specifically on the tails of the distribution. We apply Univariate Extreme Value Theory to model extreme market risk for the FTSE100 UK Index and S&P-500 US markets indices plus their volatility indices. We show with empirical evidence that EVT can be successfully applied to financial market return series for predicting static VaR, CVaR or Expected Shortfall (ES) and also daily VaR and ES using a GARCH(1,1) and EVT based dynamic approach to these various indices. The behaviour of these indices in their tails have implications for hedging strategies in extreme market conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The ideas discussed include standard autocorrelation tests, multi-period regression tests and volatility tests. The formulation and estimation of models for time-varying volatility are also considered. Dependence in second-order moments plays an important role in implementing and understanding tests for market efficiency. All of the reported test statistics and model estimates are calculated with monthly data on value-weighted NYSE stock prices and dividends. The distributions of the test statistics under various alternatives, including fads and bubbles, are illustrated through the use of Monte Carlo methods. In addition to the standard constant discount rate present value model, we postulate and simulate a new fundamental price relationship that accounts for the time-varying uncertainty in the monthly dividend growth rates. Allowing the discount rate to be a function of the time-varying uncertainty in the dividend process results in a simulated fundamental price series that is broadly consistent with most of the sample statistics of the actual data.},

We used the regression model proposed by Carhart (1997) with the addition of a market timing factor and analyzed the alpha coefﬁcient sign and signiﬁcance. Our results show that a signiﬁcant number of managers exploit well-known strategies as size, book-to-market ratio, momentum and market timing. When we use net returns series as the dependent variable, we ﬁnd that only 4.8\% of active portfolios have positive and signiﬁcant alphas. Active portfolio performance on average is not signiﬁcantly different than passive portfolio performance. But when we run the regressions using the estimated gross returns, we found that 10.3\% of active funds have positive and signiﬁcant alphas, and on average the performance of active funds is signiﬁcantly positive. Our results are in accordance with Jensen’s (1978) version of efﬁcient market, in which asset prices reﬂect existing information till the moment when marginal beneﬁts of using information do not exceed marginal costs.},
